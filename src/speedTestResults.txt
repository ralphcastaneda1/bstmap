Test Parameters:
string length: 1000
number of insertions: 50,000

Performance:
class ULLMap: 16.72 sec
class BSTMap: 0.46 sec
Java's Built-in TreeMap: 0.43 sec
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.45 sec


Analysis:
The ULLMap was the slowest which matches our intuition of the runtime of unordered
linked lists. The BSTMap was very similar in runtime to the TreeMap and HashMap all
centered right around the mid 40-second mark.
